    <h1>Bat Letter</h1>
    <p>
        After all the battles we fought together, after all the difficult times we saw together, and after all the good and bad moments we’ve been through, I think it’s time I let you know how I feel about you.
    </p>
    
    <h2>You are the light of my life</h2>
    <p>
            You complete my darkness with your light. I love:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>the way you see good in the worst things</li>
        <li>the way you handle emotionally difficult situations</li>
        <li>the way you look at Justice</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
            I have learned a lot from you. You have occupied a special place in my heart over time.
    </p>
