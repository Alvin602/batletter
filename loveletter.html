    After all the battles we fought together, after all the difficult times we saw together, and after all the good and bad moments we’ve been through, I think it’s time I let you know how I feel about you.

<p style="width:550px;">
        You complete my darkness with your light. I love:
</p>

<ul style="width:550px;">
    <li>the way you see good in the worst things</li>
    <li>the way you handle emotionally difficult situations</li>
    <li>the way you look at Justice</li>
</ul>

<p style="width:550px;">
        I have learned a lot from you. You have occupied a special place in my heart over time.
