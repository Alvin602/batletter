    After all the battles we fought together, after all the difficult times we saw together, and after all the good and bad moments we’ve been through, I think it’s time I let you know how I feel about you.

        You complete my darkness with your light. I love:<br>
        - the way you see good in the worst things<br>
        - the way you handle emotionally difficult situations<br>
        - the way you look at Justice<br>
        I have learned a lot from you. You have occupied a special place in my heart over time.<br>
